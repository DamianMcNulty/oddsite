Tips to Save Money on Development
---------------------------------

1. If you don't have the budget
to develop a full MVP or even a prototype
of your web application,
one option is to start with a hi-def mockup.
Mockups look great in a professional pitch
and take a fraction of the time and money to create.

2. Considering hiring a user experience designer
to create an interactive mockup
in Adobe Xd or Invision
and without paying for a single line of code,
you can rapidly test your ideas with users
and update the features to fit their needs.
