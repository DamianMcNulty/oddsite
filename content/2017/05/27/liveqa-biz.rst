OddBird is holding an open question and answer session
on a free slack channel
to talk with you about
developing a web app
from start to finish – the decisions you need to make
about team and technology and testing,
budget and development costs,
and how to build a user-base
without relying on "viral" mysticism.

Tips to Save Money on Development
.................................

1. If you don't have the budget
to develop a full MVP or even a prototype
of your web application,
one option is to start with a hi-fidelity mockup.
Mockups look great in a professional pitch
and take a fraction of the time and money to create.

2. Consider hiring a user experience designer
to create an interactive mockup
in `Adobe Xd`_ or `InVision`_,
and without paying for a single line of code
you can rapidly test your ideas with users,
updating the features to fit their needs.
