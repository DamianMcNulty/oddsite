Showing Gratitude
-----------------

The organizers and volunteers did a great job bringing the community together.

    Helping to plan CSSDay with my friends as a conference by developers, for
    developers, has been one of the most rewarding and exciting things that
    I've been able to do in my career. I’ve met so many amazing and talented
    people along the way. It has been an experience.

    --Brad Westfall

This was the second year `Brad Westfall`_ organized this event. We are very
thankful for conference organizers like Brad and his team, who post `videos`_
