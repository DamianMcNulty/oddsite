Birds Recommend: Color Theory for Coders
========================================

So you write code, but design intrigues you and you'd like to delve deeper.
Where to start? The sheer number of tools and tutorials is overwhelming. Later
this week, I'll be publishing an article with my recommendations for how to get
started, but while you're waiting, check out `Natalya Shelburne's`_ `Practical
Color Theory for People Who Code`_.

Sass Color Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Natalya is a fine artist, `speaker`_, and front-end developer. Her Sass color
functions make it easy to create beautiful color palettes. Start with any HSL
color â€“ for example, your client's primary brand color. Use Natalya's color
functions to find a complimentary color. Mix and lighten your primary and
secondary colors to create neutral colors. Darken and lighten these colors even
further to create black and white. Voila! You're designing with color.

In the physical world, colors that appear next to one another experience
similar lighting conditions: the bright light of morning or the dim yellow glow
of a desk lamp. Using Natalya's color functions, you can mix your primary and
secondary colors to establish the same type of color relationship on the web.
Check out Natalya's demo for detailed instructions. If you're that person who's
always asking why, she's even provided a special toggle for you!
