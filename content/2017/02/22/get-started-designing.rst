  You'd like to start learning design, but the number of tools and tutorials
  available is difficult to sort through. Where do you start? I recommend Paper
  for sketching out UX ideas, *Practice Code Theory for People Who Code* to
  generate color palettes and learn color theory, *Choosing the Right Font: A
  Practical Guide to Typography on the Web* as an introduction to typography,
  and Adobe Experience Design for UX prototyping.


Get Started with Design: 4 Useful Tools & Tutorials
===================================================

So you’re a developer or you’re brand new to the world of web design, and you’d
like to grow your design chops. How do you even begin to sort through the
overwhelming amount of tools and tutorials available? In this guide, I’ll
introduce the tools I use daily in my work as a user experience and brand
designer for OddBird. I’ll recommend quick and useful tutorials that will get
you started designing right away.


Start Sketching: Paper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When tackling a complex UX design challenge, I start with sketches. My go-to
tool is aptly named `Paper`_. Paper, by 53, is free for iPad and iPhone. The
first time I used Paper, I found the interface so clear and simple, I didn’t
need a tutorial to get started. A collapsable toolkit with several brush
styles, seven colors, and an eraser is all I need to sketch rough drafts of web
features. Here’s a sample sketch I drew using Paper during the development of
`QuarqNet`_. With Paper, I can auto-straighten uneven lines and zoom in for
detail work. When drafting logos, I often trace images. Paper lets me upload an
image, draw on top of it, and easily delete the image from the background when
I’m finished.

Color: Sass Color Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It’s important for any designer to be able to create pleasing and accessible
color palettes. If you write code, Natalya Shelburne’s Sass color functions are
an excellent tool for generating a palette that works. If you’re not a
developer, Natalya’s `Practical Color Theory for People Who Code`_ is still a
fantastic tutorial for how to think about color for the web. You’ll learn about
accessible contrast, using neutral colors, and how to simulate cohesive
lighting conditions.

Color can make or break a user’s experience on the web. If you’d like to learn
more, here’s a list of several `fun and easy-to-use tools`_ for generating
color palettes and testing contrast. I’ve also outlined my step-by-step process
for choosing brand identity colors.

Typography: A Practical Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to typography expert Jason Santa Maria, “If your type is bad, the
design fails.” There’s so much to learn in the rich field of typography. To get
started, I recommend `Choosing the Right Font, A Practical Guide to Typography
on the Web`_ by Max Luzuriaga. Max provides an overview of important elements
to consider: readability, pairing, and size.

If you have an hour, check out `Jason Santa Maria On Web Typography`_, a talk
he presented at Build Conf 2011. Or delve into his book `On Web Typography`_,
but be warned – you may get bitten by the typography bug and find yourself
regaling your friends about that horrendous typeface pairing on the menu at
your favorite restaurant.

If you know the theory and you’re looking for free, high-quality typography for
your web project, here’s a list of `my favorite resources`_. You can also read
about the process I use to select typography for a brand identity.

Prototype: Adobe Experience Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My new favorite UX design tool is still in beta. After my sketches have been
approved, I open `Adobe Experience Design`_. Xd has a built-in tutorial that’s
fun, beautiful, and takes less than an hour to complete. I use Xd prototypes to
flesh out my sketches, and to play with colors, typography, and layout. Xd is
also an excellent tool for working out how users will flow through the content.
