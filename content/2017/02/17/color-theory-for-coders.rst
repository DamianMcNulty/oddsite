In Practical Color Theory, Natalya—fine artist, speaker, and front end developer—demos the Sass color functions she created. Start with any hsl color you like, maybe your client's brand color. Color functions take all the guess work out of picking a second color. Mix a bit of each color into the other to establish a relationship. Add neutral colors so you don't overwhelm the eye. Add contrast for accessibility and keep your color palette limited for a reasonablity level of complexity. Voila! You're designing with color.
