OddBird Wants You
=================

OddBird is looking for a Python web developer, and we'd love to hear from you!


OddBirds:
---------

- are a small team (you'll be #6)
- enjoy working collaboratively on complex problems
- write tests (100% coverage everywhere, always) and do code reviews
- have lives & interests outside our work
- set our own hours, and work from anywhere (strong preference for timezones
  from -0400 to -0900)
- get 10% paid time to work on open-source software
- listen to users, and enjoy having our assumptions challenged/tested
- care about diversity in the tech community

Our process keeps design and development tightly integrated.
There are no photoshop comps thrown over the wall to developers.
Everyone is working together (with users) towards a unified goal.


You:
----

- enjoy solving complex problems with readable, efficient, tested code
- can explain the decisions behind your work, and the tradeoffs involved
- enjoy the push-and-pull of a tight feedback cycle
- work closely with designers to integrate form & function
- have experience writing Python for the web, preferably in more than one
  framework (or no framework at all!)
- enjoy exploring outside what you know, and questioning your assumptions

This isn't a cubicle job with dental, a 401k, and paid vacation.
We're also not a start-up expecting you
to work nights and weekends towards future equity.
When there's work to be done, we all do what we can,
and we get paid for our time.
This is a contract job, with long term potential,
a good hourly rate, and a lot of flexibility.


Interested?
