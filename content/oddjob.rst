OddBird Wants You
=================

OddBird is looking for a web designer, and we'd love to hear from you!


OddBirds:
---------

- are a small team (you'll be #5)
- enjoy working collaboratively on complex problems
- have lives & interests outside our work
- set our own hours, and work from anywhere
- listen to users, and enjoy having our assumptions challenged/tested
- care about diversity in the tech community

Our process keeps design and development tightly integrated.
There are no photoshop comps thrown over the wall to developers.
Everyone is working together (with users) towards a unified goal.


You:
----

- enjoy solving complex design and interaction problems
- can explain the decisions behind your work, and the tradeoffs involved
- care more about the user experience than your pixel-perfect concept
- enjoy the push-and-pull of a tight feedback cycle
- work closely with developers to integrate form & function
- understand how HTML and CSS work in the browser
- enjoy exploring outside what you know, and questioning your assumptions

This isn't a cubicle job with dental, a 401k, and paid vacation.
We're also not a start-up expecting you
to work nights and weekends towards future equity.
When there's work to be done, we all do what we can,
and get paid for our time.
This is a contract job, with long term potential,
a good hourly rate, and a lot of flexibility.


Interested?
-----------

Let's talk!
We don't need to see a resum√©, a college degree, or 15 years experience.
Just get in touch, and tell us about yourself and your work.
Contact |birds| to start the conversation.
