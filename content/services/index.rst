Shared Understanding of Goals & Constraints
-------------------------------------------

**Our process starts with
a flat-rate** `discovery phase`_
to get the entire team up-to-speed with your goals,
constraints, strategy, and user-needs.
We'll help lay out a plan for development phases,
a shared language for collaboration,
and an estimate for development.

.. _discovery phase: /services/planning/

We work collaboratively with our clients as a cohesive team,
so that everyone understands the scope and goals of the project --
with design, development, and user-experience
integrated in a tight cycle.
The user and business needs are always front and center.

Integrated Design & Code
------------------------

**The development process is agile and collaborative**,
with designers and developers working closely
to find solutions that work visually & technically
for a robust and maintainable architecture.
We're thinking about accessibility, performance,
test coverage, usability, documentation,
and hand-off from day one --
so your application can scale over time
without major refactors
and technical debt.

All of us are active in the development community --
writing, mentoring, and speaking at conferences.
We are particularly known for our contributions
and expertise in Python/Django, Sass/CSS,
automated pattern libraries, and Plone --
helping to define best-practice in our respective fields.

Whether you're looking for staff-augmentation
or an outside partner as you grow --
we provide big agency skill with the attention,
communication, and agility of an internal team.
With years of experience together,
we are able to provide smooth and efficient progress,
100% test coverage, `integrated design systems`_,
continuous review, and documentation.

We do great work, we love what we do,
and we have a track record of happy clients to show for it.
