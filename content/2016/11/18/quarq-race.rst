Quarq Race Intelligence: Real-Time Analytics
============================================

Quarq Race Intelligence captures and interprets
race performance and state-of-play information,
and delivers that data in real time to spectators,
commentators, race officials,
third-party analysis software and visualization tools.
Integrating with Quarq’s telemetry and reporting hardware,
the app shows racers’ positions, direction, speed, heart-rate,
and a number of other statistics in real time.
Our mobile-optimized web interface has been used for bicycle races,
triathlons, and non-competitive events,
including regular IronMan and Enduro races.
