  An in depth look at OddBird's design and development process on the CoachHub mobile-responsive web application. Including logo and user experience design, accessibility and usability testing, site architecture and information design.


A Responsive Web App for Wellness Coaching
==========================================


What They Needed
----------------

ORCAS partnered with OddBird to build a new, mobile-responsive, web application—a hub to connect clients with health coaches for easy, anywhere, anytime access to personalized wellness guidance and support. The new software needed to work with ORCAS’s existing suite of apps, especially MoodHacker, a tool for self-management of emotional well-being.

Studies show that telephonic health coaching can be effective, but ORCAS identified several barriers keeping clients from getting the right level of support when they needed it. In designing the CoachHub web app, we aimed to create an inviting space for clients and coaches to quickly and easily access one another in dynamic and effective ways.


Planning & Discovery Phase
--------------------------

**Collaboration & Coordination**
Since we use a tightly integrated and collaborative process, we started by establishing a communication schedule with ORCAS - Monday video meetings with both teams to demo new features, Thursday video sprint-planning meetings for team leaders to review priorities and discuss upcoming features, and a dedicated Slack chat for continuous conversation throughout the week.

**Vision & Strategy**
For an in-depth understanding of the CoachHub project and its place in the market, we created a vision & strategy with ORCAS — getting to the core of the problems faced by our users day-to-day, how our software could most help users solve those problems, where CoachHub would fit in relation to various competitors, and what approach would make it unique.

**User Profiles**
We worked closely with ORCAS to create profiles of the desired users — asking who they were, how the application would fit the schedule of their day, and what they needed to accomplish at different times from different devices? We identified three distinct users — individual users (clients), health coaches, and business partners who would provide CoachHub as part of their benefits package — and detailed the significantly different motivations and needs of each persona.

**User Stories**
Out of that conversation, we created user stories and tasks in Pivotal Tracker, where we could easily track progress, assign tasks, and manage priorities. Each story describes an action that a specific user would want to take on CoachHub. We also used Tracker to provide detailed estimates for each story, allowing ORCAS to add, prioritized, and remove stories before we started, and throughout the project — remaining up-to-date and in control of the project cost and scope.


Design & Development Phase
--------------------------

**Site Architecture & Information Design**
In order to get the whole team using the same language, we started by creating a glossary of terms (client, coach, chart, goal, permission, etc.) and the relationships between them. A client can have one or more coaches, every client has a chart, and can grant detailed chart-permissions to each coach. That glossary defined a shared basis for both database design and user-facing information architecture.

By mapping our glossary relationships onto the User Stories, we were able to lay out possible user-flows for any given situation. For each step in the flow we asked how did the user get here, what did they need to achieve, and where were they going next? Putting it all together, we created an interactive web of Content Templates — a living draft of the site architecture. Interacting with the content templates helped us find patterns. We replaced the browse-coaches page, and the my-coaches page with an ever-present sidebar giving you one-click access to coaches. Several pages stood out as important starting-points for a number of flows, and those pages moved into the site navigation.

Before starting to build features, we already had a live, interactive, and testable prototype of the information architecture and user-experience flows.


Brand Identity
--------------

We worked with ORCAS to pinpoint the emotions and associations they wanted the CoachHub brand to evoke and created a friendly and distinct brand identity. Like their existing apps — MoodHacker and BlipHub (pictured below) — the CoachHub logo and overall brand evoke bright, cheerful, and hopeful feelings.

We started with three basic brand colors and derived a full color palette from those. The visually compelling and extensive color palette gave us the wide range of colors we needed to create a vibrant garden throughout the app.

The leaf logo, with its rounded edges and playful curl, evokes feelings of friendliness and movement as well as the ideas of new life, change, and hope: turning over a new leaf.

We then created hundreds of unique avatar designs from just a few unique leaf graphics dynamically rendered using light and dark contrasts of our colors and rotation of the leaves. Because each of ORCAS’s partners will have the option to re-brand, we designed CoachHub to easily accommodate alternate logos and color palettes.


Responsive & Interactive UX Design
----------------------------------

User experience design guides feature development. For ORCAS, we sketched rough digital mockups of features and, with approval along the way, moved on to fleshed out mockup designs and finally implementation. Using this technique we moved quickly and efficiently, minimizing the chances of wasting time and money implementing the wrong features.

We designed wireframes and mockups for mobile devices first. Starting with designs for the smallest, most restricted screen sizes helped further clarify top priority and relevant information for each user at each stage of navigation through the content. Our earlier conversation with ORCAS about which users would be using which devices informed our decisions about what content to display and highlight on various devices.

CoachHub has many interactive features including the appointment calendar that allows coaches to set availability and clients to request appointments based on that availability. There are side panels that slide in to request appointments, take wellness tests, and set preferences. CoachHub offers realtime chat and notifications that fly in at the top of the screen. Interaction can become distracting if implemented for its own sake. In CoachHub these interactive features serve the needs of the user, highlighting particular features or important information.


Usability Testing
-----------------

ORCAS lead usability testing at several stages throughout the development process with one or more OddBird team members observing. Usability testing guided ORCAS in prioritizing feature development ensuring that CoachHub would be a useful and relevant product to their users and partners. This step also proved vital to the UX design of complex and interactive elements such as the appointment calendar. As we watched users navigate the app, it became clear that the appointment calendar needed one view and set of interactions for coaches and another for clients.


Accessibilty
-----------------

Accessibility is built into the core technologies and techniques we use on every project: accessible HTML5, unobtrusive Javascript, and mobile-responsive CSS styles. We make it a priority from the beginning of each project—using progressive enhancement and responsive design to support a broad range of users, devices, and browsers. For CoachHub we also used Github's Contrast Ratio tool to select colors for text that passed WCAG AA level at small sizes.


Landing Pages
-------------

We designed several different landing pages based on user type and status with unique calls-to-action to motivate engagement and highlight next steps. In conversation with ORCAS’s internal team, we designed graphics, recommended and edited text, and identified CTAs to create a relevant and compelling marketing message.


On-Going Design
---------------

CoachHub launched with a minimum viable set of features, and room to grow. We continue to work periodically with ORCAS’s internal development team, consulting on the design and flow of new features as CoachHub expands to accommodate the needs of their growing user-base — people who use it every day to improve their health and wellness, or as part of their work coaching others.
