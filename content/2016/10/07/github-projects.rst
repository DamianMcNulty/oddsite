summary: |
  With the release of kanban-style
  project boards,
  we decided to move our open-design process
  over to GitHub
  and give it a try.


Auditioning Github Projects
===========================

`Github`_ recently released
a set of new `project-management features`_,
including improved code-reviews
and `kanban`_-style "project" boards
for prioritizing issues,
and visualizing progress.

We've been using `Pivotal Tracker`_
for a long time now,
and it works well for us,
but we decided to try out Github Projects
for our `OddSite Open-Design`_ process.

My first impressions are mixed.
There's a lot to like about these new features,
and the ability to organize issues â€”
but the flow doesn't feel well-integrated yet.
We'll write about the experience
in more detail
once we've had more time
to live with it.
