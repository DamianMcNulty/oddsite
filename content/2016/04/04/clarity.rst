Clarity Conference
==================

It was an honor to be part of the first ever
`Clarity Conference`_ in San Francisco â€”
a beautiful event,
completely focussed on Style Guides.

`Chris Coyier`_ and `Brad Frost`_
both posted extensive notes on all the speakers,
and I recommend reading them.

I talked about the `code patterns`_ we use
to represent design patterns,
especially in our front-end Sass,
HTML (Jinja?),
and Javascript code.

Among other things:

- We use the cascade and pattern-specificity
  as our primary guide for organizing Sass/CSS,
  moving from the most general to the most specific.
- We use Jinja in Python, and Nunjucks in Javascript
  to write HTML templates that are less repetative and more meaningful.
  I recommend strong template logic that can be rendered
  on either the server or the client side,
  because data formatting is often a presentation concern,
  and should be accessible to the entire team.
- We use design-agnostic tools that move with us from project to project,
  our own modular html/css `system`_,
  so that we can build `tiny bootstraps for every client`_.
- We discuss naming conventions across the entire team,
  so we're all on the same page, and not stepping on toes.
