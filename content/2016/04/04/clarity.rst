Clarity Conference
==================

It was an honor to be part of the first ever
`Clarity Conference`_ in San Francisco â€”
a beautiful event
organized by `Jina`_,
and completely focussed on Style Guides.

`Chris Coyier`_ and `Brad Frost`_
both posted extensive notes on all the speakers,
and I recommend reading them.

I talked about the `code patterns`_ we use
to represent design patterns,
especially in our front-end Sass,
HTML (Jinja?),
and Javascript code.
