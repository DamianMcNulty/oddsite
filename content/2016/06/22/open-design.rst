Open Design for OddBird.net
===========================

It's time for a major overhaul of the OddBird website,
(referred to internally as "OddSite").
It's more than we can do in one pass,
so we're going to take things slow
and re-design our site in the open â€”
talking about our choices while we work.

You can get involved in several ways:

- Join our `public Slack channel`_ for front-row access to the process,
  ask us questions, and provide feedback along the way.
- Talk with us on `Twitter`_.
- Check back here for regular updates and `articles`_ as we work.
  We'll add everything to the timelines below:
