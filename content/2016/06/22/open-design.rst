Open Design for OddBird.net
===========================

It's time for a major overhaul of the OddBird website,
referred to internally as OddSite.
It's more than we can do in one pass,
before diving back into our client work,
so we're going to take things slow
and re-design our site in the open —
talking about our choices while we work.

`Open Design`_ is not a new idea,
and there are many approaches you can take.
At OddBird,
we love `collaboration`_ and `transparency`_ —
so we're going to make this process
as open and interactive as possible.
Who knows,
if it goes well,
maybe this can become a new normal for us
and even something we offer to clients.

Live & Lean Process
-------------------

We're not starting from scratch,
but we also don't want to refactor our existing site in small pieces.
Instead,
we've stripped our design down to our bare branding
(colors and fonts),
and a few typographic necessities
to keep our content readable while we work.
There's enough style left to make it a useable site
if you are landing here for the first time —
but nothing that will distract from our initial focus
on content and architecture.

This is standard for our process —
working with live templates to establish content and architecture,
before we worry about functionality,
or the final look and feel of a design.
Keeping the process fluid allows us to
test our assumptions along the way,
and make changes as we go.


Transparent & Interactive
-------------------------

There are many ways to open up a design process,
so here's our plan:


.. 1. *Content Architecture |&| User Flow* — 
..    What information are our site guests looking for,
..    and how can we make that content accessible, interesting,
..    and tuned to our company vision and goals.
..    This stage is all about the flow of a user experience,
..    what we are communicating,
..    and how our guests will interact with it.
..    Sometimes this might involve sketches and low-resolution mockups
..    to give a sense of where we're headed,
..    but mostly we're just looking at structured text in a browser.

.. 2. *Activation |&| Functionality*
..    For a site like this one,
..    activation is mostly a matter of
..    customizing our static site generator as needed
..    so that it is easy to update and maintain the site,
..    improving the markup templates,
..    and documenting our code patterns.
..    We like to focus on code in the middle of the process,
..    so it is informed by real content and architecture,
..    but can expose any technical issues
..    before we spend time making things pretty.

.. 4. *Branding |&| Design*
..    We don't spend a lot of time doing high-resolution mockups
..    early in the process,
..    because everything changes in the browser.
..    Most of our visual design happens after a feature is fully built,
..    so we're designing real, live content
..    in its final format.
