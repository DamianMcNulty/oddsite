Master Lookup Table: Urban Parcel Mapping
=========================================

With custom interactive in-browser maps,
MLT streamlines the Providence Plan staff's task
of mapping street addresses to deeded land parcels.
In addition to allowing batch imports
of large numbers of addresses from CSV files
recording user-selected associations between addresses and parcels,
MLT records an audit trail of all data changes
and allows one-click rollback of any change.
We worked closely with ProvPlan staff
to ensure the tool was easy to understand,
efficient, beautiful, and a pleasure to work with.
MLT also includes a RESTful JSON API
for querying address mapping data.
