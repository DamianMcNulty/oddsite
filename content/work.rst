**Our process is**

**1. Lean & Agile**
We use a lean and agile process to deploy & integrate new functionality frequently, aiming to deliver usable product launches as early and often as possible.

**2. Connected**
We encourage clients to stay closely connected with the daily progress, offering frequent feedback and re-prioritization via Pivotal Tracker.

**3. Accessible**
We use the accessible open web stack: semantic HTML5, unobtrusive Javascript, and advanced CSS — backed by Python & Django on the server.
