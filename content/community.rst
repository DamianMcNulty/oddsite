Grid System — Created by Miriam Suzanne

Your markup, your design, your opinions — our math.
In a world of agile development and super-tablet-multi-magic-laptop-phones,
the best layouts can’t be contained in a single framework or technique.
CSS Libraries are a bloated mess of opinions about how to do your job.
Why let the table-saw tell you where to put the kitchen?
