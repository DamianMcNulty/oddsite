Community Involvement
=====================

**We love being involved**
in the web design and development communities.
We're thankful to the wonderful people
that helped us get started,
and enjoy giving back in myriad ways,
from `open-source software`_ and `public speaking`_
to charitable giving.

.. _`open-source software`: /open-source/
.. _`public speaking`: /speaking/
