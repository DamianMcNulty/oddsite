Community Involvement
=====================

We love being part of
a vibrant web design and development community.
We benifit daily from the generous contributions of others,
and believe that a diverse network of shared experiences and ideas
makes all of our work stronger.
In addition to our `open-source software`_ and `public speaking`_,
we are proud to sponsor
organizations that increase diversity in the community —
from race and gender, to identity and sexuality —
and events that bring the whole community together
in thoughful and inclusive ways.
And then, on occasion,
we also sponsor the communities and events
that keep us entertained and fulfilled outside of work.
