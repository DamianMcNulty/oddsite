  A brief review of 2013: OddBird, year six.


2013
====

As we wrap up our sixth year, it seems as good a time as any to share our
first-ever year-end retrospective. Here's 2013, OddBird style:

- `Rachel Nabors`_ and `Claudina Sarahe`_ joined the team! Growth for its own
  sake isn't our thing (which is why it's taken us six years), but Rachel and
  Claudina kick ass and we're lucky to have them working with us.

- We had a great time working on `Portfoliyo`_ and collaborating on another
  ed-tech project with `Junyo`_. We like solving problems that matter.

- We're continuing to slowly develop Eric's `novel`_ (which has gotten some
  `rave reviews`_), and working on a (still pre-alpha) collaborative authoring
  tool.

- Eric spoke at `SassConf`_, the `New York Sass & Compass Meetup`_, and the
  `Brakhage Center for the Media Arts`_ and Carl delivered a talk on `Getting
  started with automated testing`_ at `PyCon`_. (In 2014 Carl is scheduled to
  speak at `ConFoo`_ and again at `PyCon`_).

- `We <https://github.com/jgerigmeyer>`_ `released
  <https://github.com/carljm>`_ `code <https://github.com/ericam>`_ (and
  sometimes even maintained it afterwards!) Because we like open-source
  software, and wouldn't be here without it.

- We sponsored `SassConf`_ and are silver sponsors of `PyCon`_ 2014. It's one
  small way to give back to the communities that have helped form our skills
  and built the tools we use every day.

- We donated to `PyLadies`_, the `Ada Initiative`_, `Black Girls Code`_, and
  `MACILE`_. And you should, too!

Thanks for a great year, everyone. See you around in 2014!
