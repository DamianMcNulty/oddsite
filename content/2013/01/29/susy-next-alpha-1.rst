Susy Next: The First Alpha
==========================

Last night we released
the very first `alpha build`_ of `Susy Next`_.

This release is extremely sparse.
What we have built is a background 'engine'
for calculating grid math.
There are some rough first steps towards api and syntax,
but they are more "proof of concept" experimentation
than usable interface.

There is no documentation,
no tutorials,
barely any user-facing activity to speak of.
You can get some sense of things
from the ``test/`` directory,
but even that is un-explained.

Feel free to pull it apart,
hack on it,
and let us know what you think.
We still have a long way to go,
but we're very excited about the power and flexability
this engine has to offer.

Check out the `susy-next branch on GitHub`_.
