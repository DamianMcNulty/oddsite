Carl Meyer
==========

Carl is an active owner and developer-emeritus,
providing oversight and counsel
to the development team.
He is a core developer of the Django Python web framework,
an elected member of the inaugural Django technical board,
ex-maintainer of the widely-used pip and virtualenv
package management tools,
co-author of multiple accepted
enhancements to the Python language and ecosystem,
and a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.
He is also a regular speaker
at the annual Python and Django community conferences.
When not chasing a more elegant algorithm,
he chases frisbees, hockey pucks, and a pair of sons.
