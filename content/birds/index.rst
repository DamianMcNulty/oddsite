The People You’ll Work With
===========================

You'll get to know our small,
tightly-knit team
on a first-name basis —
with direct access to everyone involved.
We'll all learn what makes your company special,
and discuss features as a team,
so we can work together with a shared understanding
of the project and goals.

Feel free to start a conversation with one of us
through the social networks listed,
in our `public Slack chat`_,
or `in person`_ at a meetup or conference.
