The People You’ll Work With
===========================

If you work with OddBird,
you will get to know our small, tightly-knit
team on a fisrt-name basis.
You'll have direct access to the team,
and we'll all take the time to learn what makes your company special,
so we're all working together with a shared understanding
of the project and goals.

Feel free to start a conversation with one of us online,
through our various social networks —
or in person at a meetup or conference.
