summary: |
  *Maps are a powerful data type in Sass* â€”
  perfect for managing color and scale palettes,
  framework configuration, data storage, and more.
  We'll find ways to integrate maps into any project
  before we push them to their limits.

  - What are Sass Maps, and how do I use them?
  - Organizing variables with maps.
  - Manipulating maps programmatically.
  - The main problems with maps, and how we work around them.
  - Automating pattern libraries and style guides based on maps.
  - Fun with maps for data-storage, and natural-language syntax.
