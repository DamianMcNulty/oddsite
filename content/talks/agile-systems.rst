  Learn how to
  **automate style documentation** by
  building patterns directly into your code.
summary: |
  *Style Guides & Pattern Libraries are great tools*
  for documenting the relationships between code and design,
  but beautiful docs are only half the battle.
  We donâ€™t all have dedicated teams and budgets
  to build a centralized system.
  How can we build patterns into our code,
  using templtes and pre-processors to iterate and automate
  living design systems in an agile and integrated process?


Agile Design Systems
====================

- Using tempaltes and pre-processors for pattern-making in CSS and HTML.
- Designing and integrating toolkits that force pattern-making.
- Examples of what we've done, where we've failed, and where we're headed.
