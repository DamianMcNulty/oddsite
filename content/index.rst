Custom web tools for humans
===========================


Odd Projects
------------

We love molding ideas into experiences,
and tools that people can use â€”
from open-source projects like `Django`_, `Compass`_, and `Susy`_,
to web applications for `Mozilla`_, `The K Network`_,
`Providence Plan`_, `Junyo`_,
and our ongoing experiments in `digital storytelling`_.

Odd Process
-----------

1. We use a **lean** process to
   deploy & integrate new functionality frequently,
   aiming to deliver usable product launches
   as early and often as possible.

2. We encourage clients to stay closely **connected** with the daily progress,
   offering frequent feedback
   and re-prioritization
   via `Pivotal Tracker`_.

3. We work with the **accessible** open web stack:
   semantic HTML5 markup,
   unobtrusive Javascript,
   and advanced CSS3 styling.
   On the server side we use Python_,
   and have extensive Django_ experience.
