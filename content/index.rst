  Custom web tools for humans

.. container:: intro

  We love chasing ideas into existence.
  We could do that all night long,
  and sometimes we do.

.. container:: projects

  .. container:: wrap

      We created `Susy`_
      for web designers like ourselves,
      and we are core contributors to
      `Compass`_,
      `Django`_,
      `pip`_,
      `virtualenv`_
      and other open-source projects.

      We're currently working on `Portfoliyo`_
      for teachers, students, and parents;
      and `Into the Green Green Mud`_,
      a multimedia novel.
      Recent projects include `MozTrap`_ for `Mozilla`_,
      and a `mapping tool`_ for `The Providence Plan`_.

.. container:: people

  **OddBird**
  is three brothers
  who thrive on freely shared ideas
  and playful collaboration,
  crossing disciplines,
  breaking boundaries
  and eating our dessert with the soup spoon.

  |Carl|
  is a coder_,
  Pythonista_,
  and Django_ core developer.
  When heâ€™s not chasing a more elegant algorithm,
  he chases frisbees, hockey pucks, and a five-year-old son.

  |Eric|
  is a `multimedia artist`_
  specializing in writing_, design_, and performance_.
  He is also a specialist in the art of
  user-interface creation and CSS-mangling_.

  |Jonny|
  is a `front-end developer`_,
  project manager,
  and occasional `college philosophy professor`_.
  He likes his frisbees thrown deep,
  his students smart-alecky,
  and his scotch served neat.

.. container:: process

  We use a **lean** process_,
  deploying and integrating new functionality frequently
  and aiming to deliver usable product launches
  as early and often as possible.

  We encourage clients to stay closely **connected** with the daily progress,
  offering `frequent feedback`_
  and re-prioritization
  via `Pivotal Tracker`_.

  We work with the open web stack:
  **accessible** semantic HTML5 markup,
  unobtrusive Javascript,
  and advanced CSS3 styling.
  On the server side we are a Python_ shop,
  and have extensive Django_ experience.
