Custom web tools for humans
===========================

.. wrap:: div
  :class: process

  We use a **lean** process to
  deploy & integrate new functionality frequently,
  aiming to deliver usable product launches
  as early and often as possible.

  We encourage clients to stay closely **connected** with the daily progress,
  offering frequent feedback
  and re-prioritization
  via `Pivotal Tracker`_.

  We work with the **accessible** open web stack:
  semantic HTML5 markup,
  unobtrusive Javascript,
  and advanced CSS3 styling.
  On the server side we use Python_,
  and have extensive Django_ experience.
