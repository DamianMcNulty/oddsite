We develop custom web tools for humans

From building web apps for companies like `Mozilla and ORCAS`_, to working on open-source tools like `Django and Susy`_ — OddBird thrives on molding big ideas into experiences that people use, playful collaboration, breaking boundaries, and eating our dessert with the soup spoon.
