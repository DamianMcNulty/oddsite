Custom web tools for humans
===========================


Odd Projects
------------

From working on open-source tools like `Django`_, `Compass`_, and `Susy`_,
to building web applications for `Mozilla`_, `The K Network`_,
`Providence Plan`_, `Junyo`_, or `ORCAS`_ —
and our own `experiments in digital storytelling`_ —
we love molding ideas into experiences that people use.

Odd Process
-----------

1. We use a **lean** process to
   deploy & integrate new functionality frequently,
   aiming to deliver usable product launches
   as early and often as possible.

2. We encourage clients to stay closely **connected** with the daily progress,
   offering frequent feedback
   and re-prioritization
   via `Pivotal Tracker`_.

3. We use the **accessible** open web stack:
   semantic HTML5,
   unobtrusive Javascript,
   and advanced CSS —
   backed by Python_
   & Django_ on the server.
