SassConf 2014
=============

|s| `SassConf`_ starts tomorrow
at the Scholastic Auditorium in New York!
We're damn proud to be sponsoring such a great event,
and even more proud this year to have
`one of the organizers`_ on our team.

|clear| But who cares about pride,
I have a flight to catch!
See you all in SoHo!
