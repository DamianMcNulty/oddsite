`Donate`_ to the `Ada Initiative`_ today to support women in
open technology and culture. If we hit $7500 by Friday, `Jacob`_ and `Alex`_
and I will match your donations to make it a nice round $15k. Life is short, go
`donate now`_!

I've spent most of my working life with Python and open technology. Python and
open source have been good to me. They've helped me `start a company`_, `become
a public speaker`_, be `recognized for my contributions`_, and make friends all
over the world.

I attended my first PyCon in 2008, and I've been to every one since. I gave my
`first PyCon talk`_ in 2011. That year, 1% of the talks were by women;
ninety-five out of ninety-six by men. Being one of those ninety-five helped me
to launch a career in open-source software. Ninety-odd other men got that same
opportunity that year; one woman did.

Three years later, thanks to the incredible outreach efforts of Jessica
McKellar, the amazing `PyLadies`_, the Ada Initiative, and many others, women
gave a **full third** of the talks at PyCon 2014.

I have two sons, a seven-year-old and a four-month-old (yep, that's him). With
the second just arrived, I think a lot these days about the work I do; I want
it to be work that will make them proud, that I will be happy to tell them
about.

I am ashamed to admit to being part of this industry when I see Kathy Sierra or
Adria Richards or Anita Sarkeesian or `Zoe Quinn`_ or `any number of other
women`_ systematically harassed, threatened, and attacked by gangs of abusive
men for the crime of speaking their minds as women.

I am ashamed to be part of this industry because of `pervasive sexual
harassment`_ and sexism at tech conferences, in the workplace, and at meetups.

I want to be able to wholeheartedly celebrate my successes and recommend
open-source software communities, but I know that I've been `playing on the
easy setting`_: paid more and presumed competent because of my gender, skin
color, cultural similarity to those in positions of power, and other attributes
that I did nothing to earn.

But I also believe all that can change. I'm proud to be a part of the Python
community when I see it `leading`_ the `way`_ in working towards being
welcoming to people who don't all look, talk, and act like me. I'm happy to be
in the Python community (and humbled by all the hard work it took to get here)
when I see this:

I'm proud to be part of the Django community when we adopt a strong `Code of
Conduct`_ (in consultation with Ada Initiative!), and when `"that time I wasn't
harassed at a conference"`_ is a description of DjangoCon.

That's the community that I want to be a part of, and the Ada Initiative is
`working every day`_ to `make it a reality`_. If that's the community you want
too, join me and `donate today`_!
