Public Speaking
===============

We've learned a lot over the years
from the freely-shared inspiration and mentoring of others,
through blogs, podcasts, and conference talks.
Now we hope to pass that generosity along,
to help keep the community vibrant and collaborative.
We love tinkering with new ideas and challenging our assumptions,
exploring tools and practices that can
increase our speed and improve our services.
We're excited to share what we're playing with,
and what we've learned along the way.
