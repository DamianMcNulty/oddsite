summary: |
  **We're constantly learning**
  from the `freely-shared`_ inspiration and mentoring of others –
  through blogs, podcasts, and conference talks –
  so we'd like to pass that generosity along:
  talking and writing
  about the tools and practices
  that have helped improve our work,
  how we think and experiment,
  and everything we've learned along the way.
