  `Miriam`_ is the creator of `Susy`_,
  the genre-defining Sass meta-grid system –
  but it's time to move our layouts
  back in the browser.
  Full of web-layout history,
  and **practical ways to take back control**,
  this talk won **"Best Of" CSS Dev Conf, 2017**.

summary: |
  We built `Susy`_,
  a Sass grid system that can generate any grid technique you like —
  but we haven't used it in years.
  `Miriam`_ will show you the history of web layout,
  how various grid systems work,
  and how to avoid using them.
  For those few cases where a grid really is required,
  we'll talk about the best ways to roll your own,
  so you're not relying on a bloated library to make decisions for you.
  We'll also look at the new layout toys —
  from flexbox to CSS Grid —
  and how to get started with only a few lines of code.
