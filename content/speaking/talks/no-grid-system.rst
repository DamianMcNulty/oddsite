  The creator of `Susy`_,
  provides **practical techniques**
  for avoiding grid systems.
  **"Best Of" CSS Dev Conf, 2017**.

  .. _Susy: /susy/
summary: |
  We built `Susy`_,
  a Sass grid system that can generate any grid technique you like —
  but we haven't used it in years.
  `Miriam`_ will show you the history of web layout,
  how various grid systems work,
  and how to avoid using them.
  For those few cases where a grid really is required,
  we'll talk about the best ways to roll your own,
  so you're not relying on a bloated library to make decisions for you.
  We'll also look at the new layout toys —
  from flexbox to CSS Grid —
  and how to get started with only a few lines of code.
