  `Stacy`_ provides an overview
  of the new features in CSS –
  from Grid Layout to typography –
  with **design inspiration**
  and **practical advice on getting started**.
summary: |
  For far too long we've been forced to reuse layout patterns
  that have worked in the past,
  creating a web full of sites that all look the same.
  Narrow timelines,
  browser support restrictions
  and lack of a true grid systems
  have led us to create work that is "good enough".

  `Stacy`_ spent years exploring
  how we can make the web a more unique space.
  With some of the newer CSS techniques available,
  we can start to make more creative designs.
  CSS Grid Layout is on the horizon
  and will play a major role in the design of our sites.
  Finally having a true,
  2 dimensional grid will give our layouts much more flexibility
  and it is on us to explore the possibilities.
