summary: |
  True is a full-featured unit-testing library for Sass developers.
  The core functionality is written in pure SassScript,
  so it can be used anywhere Sass is compiled.
  Advanced features are available in Node
  with our Mocha test-runner integration,
  and in Ruby using our command-line tools.
