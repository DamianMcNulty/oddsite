Open-Source Leadership
======================

We use open-source software regularly
in our personal and professional work,
to stay up-to-date with community best-practice
and avoid re-inventing any wheels.
We appreciate the generosity of so many in the open-source community,
and try to contribute back to the projects we use,
and share our own tools that might be useful to others.
