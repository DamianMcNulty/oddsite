summary: |
  We worked with Junyo to develop
  an early version of their Streams Resource Library —
  a community-currated directory of teaching materials.
  Teachers can collect and access
  all of their open and licensed digital resources in one library.
  Search by curriculum, student need,
  use case, content efficacy, users’ rankings,
  standards, and other criteria,
  to create custom learning streams.
  OddBird built the initial curation and search tools
  used to populate, annotate, and sort resources.
