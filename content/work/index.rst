Custom Web Software
===================


We offer the following packages to quickly get your project underway.

Package 1 - $4,000 (flat fee)
-----------------------------

Interactive Mockups for Pitch Decks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do you need a beautiful mockup of your web app for your pitch deck, to raise
your first or second round of funding?

This package is designed to help you quickly experiment with features and
demonstrate your concept to investors. We won’t take you through the full
process for planning and estimating a project, just enough to design hi-fi,
interactive mockups as a proof-of-concept for your idea. Perfect for investor
and B2B slide decks and for getting early buy-in from stakeholders and
investors. That includes:

**Project Summary:** Your chance to provide a general sense of the goals,
scope, and requirements of the project. We'll work with you to gain an
understand of your users and the core features that define your web app.

**Interactive Mockup:** Beautiful designs of the application showing core
features as defined in the Project Summary. Highly designed, interactive
visualizations of your web app that represent the content layout and
demonstrate basic features. Colors and fonts will be based on the existing
brand or an accessible placeholder brand. (Full brand identity development
process not included, but available upon request.)

Package 2 - $8,000 (flat fee)
-----------------------------

Full Project Discovery, Planning, and Development Estimate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Have you raised your first round of funding and need a design & development
partner to help make your brilliant idea a reality? Or do you need help
fleshing out your idea and documenting it with interactive demos for investors
and stakeholders? Are you curious how much it might cost to develop your
web app?

This package provides all the documentation required to take your project
to the next step. Understand the full scope of your vision, experiment with
interactive wireframes, define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and see a
full estimate for design and development. Perfect for demonstrating your
idea to investors, letting them know how much funding you need and your
plans for using the money, or for taking the leap into active production!
Along the way, we’ll deliver:

**Project Overview:** Your chance to provide a general sense of the goals, scope, and requirements of the project. Much of the information may be available in planning documents you have already generated. This is a central reference to build from.

**User Profiles:** Imagine a day in the life of your user. When and where do they use your application? What activities does a user go through during a day. At what times and in what locations will they interact with your application?

**User Stories:** A list of expected features, written as “stories” from the perspective of a single user. What are they trying to do, and why? The final list represents all of the ways that a user will interact with the application. The final development estimate will be itemized by story, making it easier to set priorities, and your budget for each phase of the project.

**Data Model/Glossary:** What are the core concepts/objects around which the application is built? These will be the models. What are the relationships between the models? What data attributes does each model have, and what is the data-type for each attribute? Giving everything a name, and describing the relationships will help guide development and keep the whole team on the same page.

**Interactive Wireframe:** A basic, interactive design of the application, showing the movement of users through core interactions defined in the User Stories. We’ll make it look good, but lo-fi and unbranded, including several linked gray-scale pages. Perfect for a proof-of-concept for generating board-member, stakeholder, or investor buy-in. This will also be useful for a development team to kick-start the full production process when you take that next step.

**Design/Development Estimate:** We’ll estimate each User Story individually, providing you with an itemized estimate, organized into phases when appropriate. We’ll work with you to add, remove, and rearrange features to find the right balance of functionality and budget.
