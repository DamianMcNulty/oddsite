      The internet was useless in deciding who to hire,
      with too much conflicting info.
      Then I found OddBird,
      providing a focussed team
      with a wide range of talent.

      I like working with you all
      because you’re high-caliber and nimble.
      Innovative at heart.
      Together,
      we fundamentally transformed
      the Chicago public school system.
