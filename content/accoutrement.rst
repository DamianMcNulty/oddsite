Sass Accoutrement
=================

OddBird's accoutrement modules
are individual Sass toolkits
that work together to form
the central configuration of a project.
The tools can be used individually,
or integrated for extra power.

- `Color`_:
  Manage your color palettes in one place,
  and access them from anywhere
  with optional accessibility guidance
  from the `WCAG`_.

.. - `Init`_:
..  Lightweight, un-opinionated browser-normalization.

.. - `Layout`_:
..   Layout tools to help you manage
..   media-queries, positioning,
..   fluid aspect-ratios, box-sizing, and float-clearing.

- `Scale`_:
  Manage a palette of consistent sizes
  to use across your project
  for typography, spacing, layout, and more.
  Create sizes based on modular-scales or other calculations,
  and access sizes in any unit you need.

- `Type`_:
  Manage your font palettes in one place,
  import them all with a single command,
  and access font-stacks on-the-fly,
  with helpers for generated content and accessibility.
