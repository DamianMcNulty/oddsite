Style Guide *&* Pattern Library
===============================

This is the living style guide for
[OddBird.net](http://oddbird.net)
and associated OddBird branding materials.

It is still in development,
using OddBird's
[Accoutrement](http://oddbird.net/accoutrement/) and
[Herman](https://github.com/oddbird/sassdoc-theme-herman/)
open-source toolkits
to automate as much living documentation as possible.
